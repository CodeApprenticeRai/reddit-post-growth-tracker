The silly things here are:
 * the data recording not complete (it's possible to not register some new posts),
 and if the data recording process ever stops ( which it often does), you just have outages
 * the data isn't filtered. The result is that a lot of data gets appended to the graph at
 the same time, making updates really slow.

 Those are my two main concerns. Beyond these I would say that a follow up concern is
 just that I don't have clear insights.

 What am I looking at?
* !? fastest growing post over some horizon ( minutes, hours )
* !? correlates between all time from-inception + horizon growth

I guess.

* notification every time a new fast grower becomes apparent.
* ??
